        Hi! <br />
        I'm Julian, and I love all the complexities and dynamics that
        writing involves.
        At The Writer's Job shop, I create printable
        worksheets for helping writers with their craft. I also love the visual
        and conceptual energy that words have when hanging on my walls. That's
        why I give words a physical dimension within the posters I create. I'm
        the author of The Affair in Blue Pages.
